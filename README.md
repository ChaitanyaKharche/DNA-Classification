# DNA-Classification

The aim of this project is to Develope a bioinformatics project for DNA sequence classification, integrating epigenetic data analysis with a focus on DNA methylation patterns. Applied machine learning techniques, using RandomForestClassifier, to predict classifications and analyze genetic influences. Enhanced data interpretation through feature engineering and visualization, demonstrating the impact of epigenetics on gene expression.
